## Credits

MySQL2 NPM package [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) to connect to MySQL database and perform queries.

Express web framework for node [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) to provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers, making it a great solution for single page applications, web sites, hybrids, or public HTTP APIs.

Handlebars.js extension [Handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/handlebars) templating language that keeps the view and the code separated.

Extension for VS code [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) to autoformat the code when saving.

Great help was rendered by cats (their mere exsistence, so thanks to all cats for inspiration) and cats' app from the class activities was extremly helpful!
